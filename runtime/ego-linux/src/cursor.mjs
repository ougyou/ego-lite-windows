/**
 * The agent's cursor — the visible "something else is driving this page" mark.
 *
 * The native macOS app draws this itself, over the web view; on Linux the page
 * is the only surface the shim controls, so the cursor is a DOM overlay
 * injected into whichever page the harness is currently acting on. It follows
 * every pointer position the harness sends, presses and springs back when a
 * button goes down and up, ripples where it clicks, sweeps the lines it reads,
 * and carries the agent's current task state as a label.
 *
 * Two properties keep it from interfering with the automation it illustrates:
 *
 *   - the host element is `pointer-events: none`, so `document.elementFromPoint`
 *     never returns it. That matters beyond cosmetics: the harness's wheel and
 *     drag fallbacks hit-test with elementFromPoint, and an overlay that
 *     answered those probes would swallow input meant for the page.
 *   - every render is fire-and-forget and swallows its own errors, so a page
 *     that refuses the injection, or navigates mid-flight, can never fail an
 *     action. The cursor is allowed to be missing; it is not allowed to break
 *     anything.
 *
 * The overlay is a Runtime.evaluate injection rather than a content script, so
 * it works on pages with a strict CSP and needs no extension.
 *
 * Env: EGO_LINUX_CURSOR=0 turns it off (it is drawn into screenshots, which is
 * usually wanted and occasionally not); EGO_LINUX_CURSOR_NAME renames it from
 * the default "DeepSeek".
