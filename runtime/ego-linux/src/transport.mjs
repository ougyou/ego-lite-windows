/**
 * CDP transport, shared between the harness and this shim.
 *
 * The harness talks to the native layer through exactly three members
 * (see package/ego-browser/src/browser-runtime.ts):
 *
 *   ego.sendCDPMessage(jsonString)   — a serialized { id, method, params, sessionId? }
 *   ego.onCDPMessage(jsonString)     — a raw protocol message, parsed by handleMessage
 *   ego.onSendCDPMessageError(msg, code)
 *
 * Chrome's browser-level WebSocket speaks that exact wire format when sessions
 * are attached with `flatten: true` (which ensureSession() does), so harness
 * traffic is a straight passthrough.
 *
 * The shim also needs its own calls (Target.getTargets for listTabs, the
 * snapshot's DOM walk, ...). Both parties share one socket, so request ids are
 * partitioned: the harness counts up from 1, the shim from INTERNAL_ID_BASE.
 * Responses to shim ids are consumed here and never reach the harness, which
 * would otherwise see ids it has no pending entry for.
